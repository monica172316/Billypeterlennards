Security Considerations
Before deploying to production:

🔒 Implement user authentication

🛡️ Add CSRF protection

📏 Set file upload size limits

🖼️ Validate image file types

✂️ Sanitize all user inputs

🔄 Use prepared statements for all database queries

Customization
Change Styling
Modify the CSS in index.php to match your brand colors:

css
/* Main color scheme */
body {
    background-color: #f5f5f5;
    color: #333;
}

/* Header and buttons */
h2 {
    color: #2c3e50;
    border-bottom: 2px solid #3498db;
}

input[type="submit"], .action-btn {
    background-color: #3498db;
}


Add More Fields
